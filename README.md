# VoteCloud

VoteCloud is an opensource webapplication that visualizes Opendata with the help of a wordcloud. 
It uses d3.js, jQuery and Materialize among others.

This application was built as part of the open data lecture at the University of Bern. A working demo can be found at http://vote-cloud.opendata.iwi.unibe.ch/.
